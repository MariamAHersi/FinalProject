# Maternal Health Monitoring App 

## Aim: 
To develop a mobile app that enables mothers to track key health metrics and receive alerts if they are at risk of complications.
## Objectives:
Design an intuitive interface for recording and visualizing health data (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate).
Implement risk analysis algorithms to alert users of potential health issues.
Integrate a map feature to locate nearby maternal wards.
Analyse maternal mortality data to inform app features and provide insights

Problem: 
Maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure and heart rate irregularities, can lead to severe outcomes, including maternal mortality. 
Early detection and regular monitoring can help mitigate risks.

Importance: 
Addressing maternal health risks is vital to improve pregnancy outcomes, reduce maternal mortality rates, and support mothers' overall well-being. 
Mothers tend to be neglected when it comes to pregnancy health and the focus is pushed more towards the baby, 

Beneficiaries: 
Pregnant women
Healthcare providers
Maternal care facilities (NHS and private).
